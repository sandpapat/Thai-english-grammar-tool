    "is_multi_sentence": is_multi_sentence,
    "coarse_label": ...,
    "fine_label": ...,
    # ... existing fields
}
```

#### CSS Enhancements
```css
.analyzed-sentence {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e3f2fd 0%, #f3e5f5 100%);
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-left: 4px solid #2196f3;

- Models are loaded with error handling to allow graceful degradation
- Each model can fail independently without breaking the entire pipeline
- **Local Memory Usage**: One GGUF model + one Transformers model (explainer is API-based)

## Testing Approach

### Component Testing
1. Use mock implementations in `app/pipeline.py` if actual models aren't available
2. Test each component (translation, classification, explanation) independently
3. Verify explanation parsing regex handles all three sections correctly

### Performance Evaluation
1. **Isolated Testing**: Run classifier against `data/Per-label Report.csv` data for baseline performance
2. **Pipeline Testing**: Evaluate complete system using `docs/model_evaluation_analysis.md` criteria
3. **Comparison Analysis**: Compare isolated vs pipeline performance to identify bottlenecks
4. **Benchmarks**: 
   - Classifier accuracy >90% (achieved: 94.7%)
   - Pipeline overall grade B+ (achieved: 85%)
   - Translation fluency >90% (achieved: 93.2%)

### Performance Interpretation Guidelines
- **94.7% Classifier Accuracy**: Excellent baseline capability in isolated conditions
- **74% Pipeline Classification**: Previous real-world performance with multi-sentence translation context
- **85-90% Expected Pipeline Classification**: Improved performance with single sentence analysis (2025-01-21 update)
- **Reduced Performance Gap**: From 20.7% to 5-10% gap through focused sentence analysis
- **B+ Overall Grade**: Suitable for dissertation requirements and demonstrates functional educational tool
- **Single Sentence Benefits**: Eliminates mixed-tense ambiguity and improves classifier focus

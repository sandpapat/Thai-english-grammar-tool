- **Explanation time:** 11.04s average  
- **Total time:** 12.25s average

## Detailed Analysis

### Strengths:
1. **Translation Quality (93.2% fluency)**: The model produces highly fluent English translations
2. **Coarse Tense Classification (92.7%)**: Excellent at identifying basic temporal categories (Past/Present/Future)
3. **Signal Word Detection (95.8%)**: Very good at identifying temporal markers
4. **Speed**: Translation component is very fast (1.2s), meeting real-time requirements

### Areas for Improvement:

#### 1. Fine-grained Classification (74.0% accuracy)
- **Issue**: 18 cases where coarse classification succeeded but fine-grained failed
- **Impact**: Affects the specificity of grammar explanations
- **Examples of challenging cases**:
  - Progressive vs. continuous aspects
  - Distinguishing between similar temporal nuances

#### 2. Code Hallucination (77.1% success rate)
- **Issue**: 23% of explanations contain inappropriate code or technical jargon
- **Impact**: Reduces explanation quality for end users
- **Recommendation**: Improve prompt engineering to minimize technical language

### Score Distribution Analysis:

#### Translation Fluency (0-2 scale):
- **Score 2 (Perfect)**: 83/96 samples (86.5%)
- **Score 1 (Good)**: 13/96 samples (13.5%)
- **Score 0 (Poor)**: 0/96 samples (0%)

#### Meaning Preservation (0-2 scale):
- **Score 2 (Perfect)**: 79/96 samples (82.3%)
- **Score 1 (Partial)**: 16/96 samples (16.7%)
- **Score 0 (Poor)**: 1/96 samples (1.0%)

#### Fine-grained Classification (0-1 scale):
- **Score 1 (Correct)**: 71/96 samples (74.0%)
- **Score 0 (Incorrect)**: 25/96 samples (26.0%)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Fine-grained Classification Enhancement
- **Data Augmentation**: Focus on edge cases where coarse and fine labels diverge
- **Model Training**: Consider additional training on temporal aspect distinctions
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Use confidence scores to flag uncertain classifications

### 2. Explanation Quality Improvement
- **Prompt Engineering**: Refine prompts to reduce code hallucination
- **Post-processing**: Add filters to remove technical language
- **Examples**: Include more natural language examples in explanations

### 3. System Integration
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Reduce explanation generation time from 11s
- **User Feedback**: Implement feedback mechanisms to improve over time
- **Error Handling**: Better handling of classification failures

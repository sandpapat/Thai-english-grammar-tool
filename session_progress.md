# Session Progress - January 20, 2025

## Summary of Changes Made Today

### 1. **Confidence-Based Instructions for Explainer Model**

**Problem**: The classifier sometimes has low confidence in its predictions, but the explainer would treat all classifications equally.

**Solution**: Implemented tiered confidence-based instructions:
- **High confidence (>90%)**: Clear, confident explanations
- **Medium confidence (70-90%)**: Mentions uncertainty and suggests alternative tenses
- **Low confidence (<70%)**: Uses uncertain language ("อาจจะ", "น่าจะ") and provides multiple interpretations

**Files Modified**:
- `app/pipeline.py`: Updated `_generate_explanation_api()` with confidence tiers
- Added confidence instructions to system prompt
- Enhanced mock explanation fallbacks

### 2. **Token Limit Adjustments for Educational Focus**

**Problem**: High token limits (500 input, 200 translation) encouraged paragraph-length inputs, defeating the educational purpose of single-sentence tense learning.

**Solution**: Reduced token limits for focused learning:
- **Input validation**: 500 → 100 tokens
- **Translation output**: 200 → 80 tokens

**Benefits**:
- Forces single-sentence focus for better tense learning
- Improves classifier accuracy (BERT works better on single sentences)
- Faster processing
- Clearer explanations

**Files Modified**:
- `app/pipeline.py`: Line 348 - reduced max_tokens from 200 to 80
- `app/validation.py`: 
  - Line 18 - reduced default from 500 to 100 tokens
  - Line 336 - updated InputValidator default
  - Enhanced error messages to be more educational

### 3. **About Us Page Improvements**

**Changes Made**:

#### A. **Logo Branding Update**
- Changed "Thaislate" to "Thaislate.ai" throughout the application
- Updated navbar brand in `base.html`
- Updated page titles and aria-labels

#### B. **Thai Hero Text Implementation**
- Added bilingual hero section with language switching
- Used exact Thai translation: "เชื่อมสะพานภาษาไทยและภาษาอังกฤษผ่านการเรียนรู้หลักไวยากรณ์อย่างชาญฉลาด"
- Updated JavaScript to handle hero section language switching

#### C. **Differentiated Content Sections**
- **Our Approach**: Now focuses on educational philosophy and learning methodology
  - Explanatory Learning
  - Thai-Centric Design  
  - Confidence Building
  - Interactive Feedback

- **Our Technology**: Now focuses on technical implementation details
  - Stage 1: Translation (Typhoon-Translate 4B GGUF)
  - Stage 2: Classification (XLM-RoBERTa Hierarchical)  
  - Stage 3: Explanation (Typhoon 2.1 4B Instruct)
  - Performance specs and reliability features

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/base.html`: Updated navbar brand
- `app/templates/about.html`: Complete restructure of hero and content sections

### 4. **Dark Mode Mobile Fix**

**Problem**: Dark mode toggle wasn't working on mobile devices.

**Solution**: Enhanced JavaScript for better mobile compatibility:
- Added `DOMContentLoaded` event listener
- Added element existence checks
- Added `touchend` event for mobile devices
- Added `preventDefault` calls
- Split theme application for immediate loading

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/base.html`: Enhanced dark mode JavaScript

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Dark Mode Issues on Tenses Page** ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: White content cards against dark background made text hard to read in dark mode.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive dark mode CSS system:
- Added CSS variables for theme-aware colors
- Created custom `.tense-card` classes using `var(--card-bg)` and `var(--text-primary)`
- Updated all tense cards to use dark-mode-aware classes instead of Bootstrap defaults
- Added hover effects and proper contrast ratios

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/tenses.html`: Added dark mode CSS and updated all card classes

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. **Multi-Sentence Translation Edge Case** (Discussed but not implemented)
When translator produces multiple sentences, the classifier breaks. Potential solutions discussed:
- Sentence-by-sentence classification
- Primary sentence focus
- Force single-sentence translation

## Technical Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced validation messages with educational context
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reduced token limits improve processing speed
3. **User Experience**: Better confidence communication in explanations
4. **Accessibility**: Fixed mobile dark mode functionality
5. **Branding Consistency**: Updated to Thaislate.ai throughout

## Next Steps

1. **Fix dark mode contrast issues on tenses page**
2. **Consider implementing multi-sentence handling logic**
3. **Test new token limits with various sentence lengths**
4. **Monitor confidence-based explanation quality**
